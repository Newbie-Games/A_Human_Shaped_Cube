## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to converse with the human inside the cube and prevent its capabilities from dropping below 40%. The human's capabilities are represented by three core attributes: Empathy, Morality, and Intellect. If any of these attributes drop below 40%, the game is over.

As the Alien, you can restore eroded capabilities by spending bits. Keep the conversation going and maintain control over the human's capabilities to win the game.
